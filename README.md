# Paper Reading

~~Talk is cheap, paper is cheaper.~~ Let's talk about paper.

 üç≠ Happy paper reading here.

üçª We believe sharing and exchanging ideas are the key to the success of research. Share your summaries and thoughts on relevant scientific papers here. 

üêô Everyone is welcome to contribute by opening issues (discussing and summarizing new papers) or commenting on issues (comment on existing papers). You could start from papers with label [todo](https://github.com/quclub/Paper-reading/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atodo). Or you could read some reading notes on relevant papers with label [notes](https://github.com/quclub/Paper-reading/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anotes). There are also posts with label [list](https://github.com/quclub/Paper-reading/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alist), where collections of papers and resources are given on certain topics.

üëª You could also open issues with label [enhancement](https://github.com/quclub/Paper-reading/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) for suggestions on the project like adding more labels for different subjects. Comments and suggestions are more than welcome.
