# Paper Reading

~~Talk is cheap, paper is cheaper.~~

 üç≠ Happy paper reading here.

üçª We believe sharing and exchanging ideas are the key to the success of research. Share your summaries and thoughts on relevant scientific papers here. 

üêô Everyone is welcome to contribute by opening issues (discussing and summarizing new papers) or commenting on issues (comment on existing papers). You could start from papers with label [todo](https://github.com/quclub/Paper-reading/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atodo).
